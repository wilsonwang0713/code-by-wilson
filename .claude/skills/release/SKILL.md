  Cut a code-by-wire release. Use when the maintainer says "bump version",
  "bump vX.Y.Z", "release it", "ship it", or otherwise wants to prepare or
  publish a vX.Y.Z release. Phase-aware: phase 1 prepares the version bump,
  changelog, and PR before release; phase 2 hands off the tag and shepherds CI
  to a verified draft after the PR merges. Mechanics live in docs/RELEASING.md.

# Release

The maintainer drives releases in two phases. Pick the phase from what they
asked and the repo state; never run both at once.

- **Phase 1 — "bump version"**: the bump/changelog/PR are not on `main` yet.
- **Phase 2 — "release it"**: the bump PR has merged to `main`; now tag and ship.

`package.json` `version` is the source of truth; the tag is `v` + that exact
string. Full mechanics and recovery steps are in `docs/RELEASING.md` — read it
when you need CI internals or to recover a botched release.

## Phase 1 — "bump version" (before release)

Do all the prep on a branch and open the PR. **Do not tag.**

1. **Pick the version.** Semantic Versioning. If the bump level (patch/minor)
   is ambiguous from the commit range, confirm with the maintainer.
2. **Branch off `main`.** `git switch main && git pull`, then a fresh branch.
3. **Set `version` in `package.json`** to `X.Y.Z`.
4. **Update `CHANGELOG.md`.** It follows Keep a Changelog + SemVer.
   - Open a dated `## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD` section.
   - Fill it from the `vLAST..HEAD` commit range, grouped as
     Added / Changed / Removed / Fixed. Fold within-feature fixups into the
     feature's bullet; list only genuinely separate, user-facing fixes under
     Fixed. Audit the range against the entry — don't trust a first pass.
   - Repoint `[Unreleased]` and add the `[X.Y.Z]` compare link in the footer so
     the links chain (`vPREV...vX.Y.Z`).
   - If a prior shipped version has no notes, backfill it from its own tag range.
5. **Commit.** Bump + changelog in one `build(release): vX.Y.Z` commit. Keep
   unrelated changelog backfills as separate `docs(changelog):` commits.
   Conventional Commits; no `Co-Authored-By` trailer.
6. **Verify.** `pnpm format` and `pnpm lint` (CI runs `format:check` then
   `lint` and fails on either). Lint warnings in `src/main/provider/claude/`
   are intentional — leave them.
7. **Push and open the PR.** No tag, no PR-body footer.
8. **Hand off.** Tell the maintainer the PR is ready; after it merges they'll
   say "release it" (phase 2).

## Phase 2 — "release it" (after the PR merges)

The tag is the trigger; CI builds the dmg into a draft release.

1. **Confirm state.** `git switch main && git pull`; check the bump commit is on
   `main` and `node -p "require('./package.json').version"` equals the version to
   tag.
2. **Hand the tag push to the maintainer.** Claude Code on the web runs behind a
   git proxy scoped to the session's feature branch: pushing any other ref —
   tags included — returns **HTTP 403**, and the GitHub tools here can't create
   a tag/ref. So prepare and verify everything, then give the maintainer the
   exact commands to run from a local clone:

   ```
   git switch main && git pull
   git tag vX.Y.Z
   git push origin vX.Y.Z
   ```

   Web-UI alternative: Releases → Draft a new release → choose tag `vX.Y.Z`
   ("create on publish"), target `main` → **Publish** (saving a draft does *not*
   create the tag, so CI won't fire). This publishes immediately, so the release
   is briefly visible without assets until CI's upload step finishes.
3. **Shepherd CI to a verified draft.** CI success and new tags aren't delivered
   as webhook events, so wait for the maintainer's "tag pushed" ping (or arm a
   monitor). Then:
   - Watch the `Release` run via the GitHub Actions tools: `verify` (fails fast
     if tag ≠ `package.json`) → the `macos-14` build.
   - **On failure:** pull the job logs, report the cause. If it was a flake,
     re-trigger by re-pushing the tag — also maintainer-only:
     `git push origin :refs/tags/vX.Y.Z && git push origin vX.Y.Z`.
   - **On success:** confirm the **draft** release for `vX.Y.Z` carries all three
     assets: `Code-by-wire-X.Y.Z-arm64.dmg`, its `.blockmap`, and
     `latest-mac.yml`. An empty asset list means the upload step didn't run —
     read the release job log.
4. **Hand back to publish.** Remind the maintainer to open the draft, confirm the
   notes match the `X.Y.Z` CHANGELOG section, and **Publish release** —
   publishing is the maintainer's call. If the tag was created via the web UI
   (already published, no draft), just verify the assets landed on that release.
