**Pilot every Claude Code session, view its enriched transcript, and monitor
the telemetry, in one interface.**

![Code-by-wire: a live Claude Code session with the session rail, transcript, and telemetry panels](docs/assets/cbw-screenshot.png)

## Features

Needs Claude Code installed locally. Open the app and every session already
running on your machine is there.

- **Every session in one rail.** Manage every session running on your
  machine from one rail: grouped by project, searchable, each flagging its
  live state.
- **Drive, fork, or just watch.** Spawn a session in an embedded terminal,
  fork a live one, adopt one you started elsewhere, or observe it read-only.
- **The full transcript.** Every message, tool call, and result,
  reconstructed from disk and rendered cleanly.
- **The telemetry the CLI hides.** Context pressure, spend, token throughput,
  duty cycle, git, tasks, subagents, and background shells, live per session.
- **The whole story.** A cross-session Stats view with a year-long
  contributions calendar and exact, never-estimated totals.
- **Your rate limits in view.** Your account's rate-limit windows, read
  straight from disk, with live reset countdowns.

One click starts the download. Always the latest release. You'll need
[Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) installed
locally, so there are sessions to observe and control.

On macOS, open the `.dmg` and drag Code-by-wire to Applications. The app is
signed and notarized by Apple, so it opens straight away. On Windows, run the
`.exe`; it's unsigned for now, so if SmartScreen warns, click
**More info → Run anyway**.

Once installed, the app checks for new releases on launch and updates from
Settings → About.

## Build from source

```
pnpm install
pnpm rebuild:native   # rebuild better-sqlite3 + node-pty for Electron's ABI
pnpm dist             # macOS: writes the .dmg to release/
pnpm dist:win         # Windows: writes the .exe to release/
```

A locally built app is unsigned: on macOS the first launch may need a
right-click → **Open**, or clearing the quarantine flag with
`xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Code-by-wire.app`; on Windows,
SmartScreen may warn: click **More info → Run anyway**.

## Develop

```
pnpm install
pnpm rebuild:native   # rebuild better-sqlite3 + node-pty for Electron's ABI
pnpm dev              # launch the app
```

`pnpm test` runs the provider read tests over the redacted `.claude` fixtures
in `tests/fixtures/`. `pnpm typecheck` checks the main and renderer projects.
