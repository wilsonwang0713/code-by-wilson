**The cockpit for local Claude Code.**

Claude Code writes a rich trail to the `.claude` directory as it works: every
turn, every token, every tool call, the running cost, the context window. The
CLI shows you almost none of it. Code-by-wire reads that trail and turns it into
one live dashboard. Every session on your machine in one place, with live state,
the full transcript, an embedded terminal to drive or take over, and the
telemetry the terminal hides. One pane instead of a dozen terminal windows.

## What you get

- **Every session in one rail.** Grouped by what needs you first: waiting,
  working, idle, ended.
- **Drive or just watch.** Spawn a managed session in an embedded terminal, or
  observe any other session read-only.
- **The full transcript.** Every message, tool call, and result, reconstructed
  from disk and rendered cleanly.
- **The telemetry the CLI hides.** Live cost, context window, token throughput,
  git, tasks, and subagents, per session.
- **The whole story.** A cross-session overview with a year-long contributions
  calendar and exact, never-estimated totals.
- **Knows your account.** Reads your plan and rate-limit gauges straight from
  the `.claude` directory.

## Features

Nothing to set up. Open the app and every session already running on your
machine is there.

### 👀 See every session at a glance

**Grouped by what needs you.** A filter box narrows the list as you type. Each
state group (Waiting, Working, Idle, Ended) carries a sticky header and a live
count, and Ended collapses by default. It's the archive, not the live work.

### 🕹️ Drive or watch any session

**Observe safely, adopt later.** A session you started elsewhere shows up
read-only, because two processes writing one transcript would corrupt it. Once
it ends, adopt it to resume inside the app and take the controls. The adopt
button appears only when the original process is gone, the only time it's safe.

**Terminal or transcript.** A managed session toggles between its live terminal
and the rendered transcript. Switching away only detaches the view. The terminal
keeps buffering, so you never lose scrollback.

### 📜 Read exactly what the agent did

**The full transcript, step by step.** Every message, tool call, and tool
result, reconstructed from the raw transcript on disk and rendered cleanly.

**Turn timeline.** A turn-by-turn strip below the live view: each prompt you
sent, how many tools it triggered, how long the turn ran, and how long ago it
started.

### 📊 The telemetry Claude Code keeps out of sight

A right-hand rail of live panels:

- **Context.** How full the window is, as a ring toward the ceiling, using
  Claude's own number when it reports one. The session rail also flags any
  session whose context is running high.
- **Cost.** The session's spend, with a donut of where it went by token kind and
  how much the prompt cache saved. On a subscription account this is _equivalent
  API value_: what the tokens would cost at API rates. A reference figure, never
  money owed.
- **Tokens.** Input, output, and cached totals as a stacked bar.
- **Token speed.** Live throughput, output and input rates over a rolling window.
- **Git.** Branch, lines added and removed, ahead/behind, current SHA, and
  working-tree status. Hidden when the directory isn't a repo.
- **Tasks.** The session's task list with each item's status and what it's
  blocked by.
- **Subagents.** The tree of child sessions a session spawned, nested by depth.
- **Session.** Model, effort level, and the run clock.

### 📈 The whole story across every session

**Overview is where the app opens.** Pinned to the top of the rail, an app-level
view that totals every Claude Code session on your machine, not just the one
you're watching. Pick a range: Today, 7d, 30d, 90d, or All.

**Headline numbers.** Sessions, turns, tokens, and equivalent API value for the
range, with a stacked bar of where the tokens went.

**A contributions calendar.** A year of activity as a heatmap, colored by turns,
tokens, or equivalent API value. Click any day to scope the whole page to it.

**Daily usage.** One stacked bar per day, split by token kind or by model.

**Three ways to slice it.** By model, by project with each project's branches
folded in, and by session in a sortable table. An _Include cache_ toggle decides
whether cached tokens count toward the totals.

**Exact, never estimated.** Every number is read straight from the transcripts
on disk, deduped and totalled. No sampling, no guesses. The first launch
backfills your history behind a progress bar, then it stays live like everything
else.

### 💳 Know your account

The rail header reads your account straight from the `.claude` directory. On a subscription
(Pro or Max) it shows your plan and rate-limit gauges with live reset
countdowns, so you can see how close you are to a wall. On an API account it
shows the endpoint host and plan.

## Install

Download the prebuilt app, or build it yourself.

### Download

1. [Download the latest `.dmg`](https://github.com/luojiahai/code-by-wire/releases/latest).
2. Open it and drag Code-by-wire to Applications.
3. Launch it. The app is signed and notarized by Apple, so it opens straight
   away, no Gatekeeper warning and no quarantine workaround.

### Build from source

Build an unsigned `.dmg` locally instead:

```
pnpm install
pnpm rebuild:native   # rebuild better-sqlite3 + node-pty for Electron's ABI
pnpm dist             # writes the .dmg to release/
```

Open the `.dmg` from `release/` and drag Code-by-wire to Applications. Because
it's unsigned, the first launch may need a right-click → **Open**, or clearing
the quarantine flag:

```
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Code-by-wire.app
```

## Requirements

- macOS (Apple Silicon)
- [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) installed
  locally, so there are sessions to observe and control

## Develop

```
pnpm install
pnpm rebuild:native   # rebuild better-sqlite3 + node-pty for Electron's ABI
pnpm dev              # launch the app
```

`pnpm test` runs the provider read tests over the redacted `.claude` fixtures
in `tests/fixtures/`. `pnpm typecheck` checks the main and renderer projects.
