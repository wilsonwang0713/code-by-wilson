/**
 * Bump when the turn schema changes. The analytics store is durable: a full disk scan is expensive to
 * redo, so migrate never DROPs a table and a live-index bump (ADR-0002) can't touch this separate file.
 *
 * v2 adds `processed_files` (the incremental high-water marks) and does a ONE-TIME `DELETE FROM turns`.
 * That delete is the single exception to "never lose history on a bump": slice 2 re-keys an id-less
 * turn's surrogate from the parsed-row index to the absolute line number (so an incremental, mid-file
 * parse keys it the same way a full parse does), and the only coherent way to switch schemes is to let
 * the next scan rebuild `turns` from disk. It's a deliberate, related migration — not the unrelated
 * churn the durability rule guards against — and the chunked backfill repopulates within seconds.
 *
 * Critically the delete is scoped to exactly the v1 -> v2 step (`from === 1`), NOT every upgrade: it
 * must never re-run on a future bump, or a later schema change would silently re-wipe a v2+ user's
 * durable history — the precise durability violation this file guards against.
