 * The set of session ids THIS app run spawned and controls — the single authority for whether a
 * discovered session is Managed. The provider consults `has` when labelling; the terminal manager
 * calls `add` on spawn and `remove` when the pty dies (natural exit or window close). In-memory by
 * design: a Managed session lives only as long as its pty, so once that pty is gone the id is dropped
 * and discovery re-derives the session as Observed (Adopt, issue #14, is the path to resume it).
 *
 * Each id is anchored to its pty's `pid`, not just its name: `/clear` rotates the Claude session id
 * under the same process, so `entries`/`rename` let the sync follow a living pty to its new id instead
 * of losing it to Observed.
