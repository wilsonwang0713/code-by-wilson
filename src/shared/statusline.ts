 *   no rate_limits) a newer no-limits capture can't override an older with-limits one. Each window is
 *   dropped once its reset has passed, so a stale capture can't show an expired limit as current. A
 *   dormant subscriber (all windows expired) stays subscription — the rate_limits history is proof.
 * - api: no capture ever carried rate_limits (no subscription evidence) and at least one fresh sample
 *   exists. A capture with rate_limits — even all-expired — is proof of a subscription, so a dormant
 *   subscriber is NEVER relabeled API billing.
 *
 * Returns null when there's no recent statusLine data at all (the UI reads null as "no bars").
