 * The End-session button's tiny state machine: a mid-turn confirm gate. `run` performs the end (a
 * fire-and-forget kill); `midTurn` routes the first click through a confirm because a turn is in flight and
 * would be cut. No busy flag or re-entrancy guard: kill is idempotent on a dead/missing pty (unlike Fork,
 * which mints a new id and needs the guard), and the optimistic overlay flips the button away on the next
 * render.
 *
 * `armed` clears a stale open confirm when the gate is no longer valid — the session ended (the button is
 * gone) or its turn finished (the "a turn is in progress" warning no longer holds). Without it confirmOpen
 * outlives the condition that opened it: a background sync flipping the row to idle leaves the dialog lying,
 * and worse, a sync ending the row then a same-id Adopt (Workspace is keyed by id, so it doesn't remount)
 * would re-show a confirm the user never asked for, whose accept kills the freshly-adopted session. Same
 * shape as useResumeAction's `armed` reset.
