## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.2] - 2026-06-12

### Changed

- Releases are now signed with a Developer ID certificate and notarized by
  Apple, so the downloaded `.dmg` opens without a Gatekeeper warning.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-06-12

### Added

- API billing mode in the account rail. It shows host and plan for API-billed
  accounts and tells them apart from Pro/Max subscriptions.
- macOS editing keys in the terminal (Ctrl-A/E, Esc-b/f, Ctrl-W/U/K), so the
  Claude Code prompt answers the usual readline shortcuts.

### Changed

- Moved the New session button into the sidebar.
- Simplified the account rail to host and plan, dropping Auth and Via.
- Made the terminal borderless with an edge scrollbar so it fills its panel.
- Trimmed the global header to 40px.
- Anchored the wordmark top-left, sliding into the corner in fullscreen once the
  traffic lights clear.
- Tightened the Session and Git panel row spacing to match the rail.

### Removed

- Intel (`x64`) builds. Releases are Apple Silicon (`arm64`) only.

### Fixed

- Self-heal a wrapped `settings.json` when its `state.json` goes missing.
- Drop the subscription label once every rate-limit window has expired.
- Force the sRGB color profile so packaged colors match dev.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-11

### Added

- First public release. A dark macOS desktop app that monitors and controls
  local Claude Code sessions: one row per session, live state (Working,
  Waiting, Idle, Ended), and transcript, tasks, tokens, cost, and git panels,
  served from an embedded SQLite index.
- Unsigned `.dmg` published to GitHub Releases.
